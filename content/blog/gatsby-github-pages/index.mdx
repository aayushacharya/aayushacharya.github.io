There are a couple of ways to deploy a Gatsby site to GitHub pages. In this tutorial I'll walk you
through three approaches I find to be useful.

Do check out the official Gatsby [documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/previews-deploys-hosting/how-gatsby-works-with-github-pages/)
for this course of action first.

üí° This tutorial assumes that you have a basic understanding of Gatsby.

üßæ One of the approaches uses GitHub Actions, follow their [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to perform CI jobs.

## How SSG in Gatsby works

Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing
fast websites and apps. One of the primary use case of Gatsby is Static Site Generation(SSG), which
is useful for deploying personal websites with more granular control.

Typical Gatsby directory structure is as follows.

```
/
|-- /.cache
|-- /plugins
|-- /public
|-- /src
    |-- /api
    |-- /pages
    |-- /templates
    |-- html.js
|-- /static
|-- gatsby-config.js
|-- gatsby-node.js
|-- gatsby-ssr.js
|-- gatsby-browser.js
```

When you run `gatsby build` command, the public directory gets populated with static files
optimized for production. The content of the public directory is what you will want to deploy
in your website.

## Deployment strategies

You can navigate to the next two strategies from the table of contents in the top right hand corner.

### Naive approach

<Callout>
  üö´ Do not use this approach, it only depicts why the next two strategies are
  important.
</Callout>

In a Gatsby project the `public` directory is usually added in the `.gitignore` file. But there
is no stopping from intializing the public directory as a git repo and setting its remote to your
GitHub repository.

```zsh
git init public -b main
cd public
git add .
git commit -m"First commit"
git remote add origin <REMOTE_URL>
git remote -v
git push origin main
```

You can use the `gatsby build` command to generate the static files in the `public` directory.
Every time you have to deploy, you can add, commit and push the files inside `public` directory.
One can also write a custom deployment script in `package.json`, which executes whenever
`npm run deploy` is executed in Gatsby project's root directory.

```js
"scripts":{
    ...,
    "deploy": "gatsby build --prefix-paths && ./deploy.sh",
}
```

where `deploy.sh` contains,

```bash
#!/bin/bash

cd public/
git add .
git commit -m"Updated"
git push origin main
```

You can immediately see the shortcomings of this approach. Creating two repositories for the
same project is not the best practice. Moreover, the shell script would not run on Windows OS
without major workarounds. There is the option of writing a custom script `deploy.js` but then
again, it requires effort for something with tidy alternatives. Which brings us to the
second approach.

### The gh-pages package

<Callout>
  üëç This is the most convenient approach. Just follow the steps and you'll be
  golden.{" "}
</Callout>

GitHub Pages provides the functionality of publishing a specific branch for your website.
Go to your repository, and navigate to `Settings > Pages > Source` where you can set the branch
from which the site is built. Now to push the static files to GitHub pages, we can either spend
time and effort to write custom scripts, which when done right does offer flexibility.

But the easiest way is by using the [gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages) package.

```shell
npm install gh-pages --save-dev
```

Then similar to what we did on the naive approach, we can add custom script on `package.json` file
which executes on `npm run deploy`.

```js
"scripts":{
    ...,
    "deploy": "gatsby build && gh-pages -d public -b gh-pages",
}
```

See the article, [Deploying to a path on GitHub Pages](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/previews-deploys-hosting/how-gatsby-works-with-github-pages/#deploying-to-a-path-on-github-pages)
on the official Gatsby docs for sites deployed at path like `username.github.io/reponame/`

### GitHub Actions

<Callout>
  ‚úÖ This is the recommended approach but does require basic CI understanding.
</Callout>

If you are new to GitHub Actions, it helps automate, customize, and execute
your software development workflows right in your repository. You can discover, create,
and share actions to perform any job you'd like, including CI/CD, and combine actions
in a completely customized workflow.

First, we must create a **YAML** file defining workflow configuration in the
`.github/workflows` directory. A workflow is a configurable automated process
made up of one or more jobs. A basic workflow configuration file for Gatsby CI is given below.  
[Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)
provides extensive syntactical information for workflow configuration file.

```yaml
name: Gatsby CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [12.x, 14.x, 16.x]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
          cache: "npm"
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build --if-present
      - run: npm test
      - name: Deploy üöÄ
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@4.1.5
        with:
          branch: gh-pages # The branch the action should deploy to.
          folder: public
          repositoryName: deploy_to_repo #Skip this if deploying to same repo
          token: ${{ secrets.ACCESS_TOKEN }} #Skip this when deploying to same repo
```

Okay, so plenty of things need explaining in this YAML file. First, this automated process is
performed on a **push** or on a **pull request** to the `main` branch. If these events
are triggered, then a job is run on the latest Ubuntu build, performing **installation**,
**build** and **test** on the 3 specified node versions.

<Callout>

‚ùó It should be noted that **_build_** and **_test_** scripts should be present in
`package.json` file. Build scripts must in some form call the `gatsby build` command.
`- run: npm test` can be removed if no test cases have been written, but it is good
practice to write test cases for your project as it validates whether your recent push
or PRs break your app's functionality.

</Callout>

Finally the contents of `public` folder is pushed to the `gh-pages` branch. This is a basic
work configuration file. For pushing to a different repository, personal access token must
be created from [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens). Copy that token and set it
in `Settings > Secrets > New repository secret` your GitHub repository.
This can now be accessed through `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}` in the YAML file.
