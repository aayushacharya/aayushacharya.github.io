Ladies and gentlemen, gather 'round, for a battle of the finest minds.
In the realm of consensus, a clash of legends, you'll find.
Classical and Nakamoto, their algorithms boast.
Each claiming superiority, aiming to outdo the most.

With Leslie Lamport and Satoshi Nakamoto as their guiding light,
they'll rap and diss, showcasing their might.
In Round 1, the battle of origins will unveil,
the history, the problems, the solutions that never fail.

In Round 2, features will come face to face,
a battle of practical prowess, they'll embrace.
Then, in Round 3, real-world applications they'll explore.
Classical and Nakamoto, the ultimate rapport.

So, brace yourselves for this consensual confrontation,
a rap battle like no other, a mind-blowing revelation.
Who will triumph in this epic rap strife?
Stay tuned and witness the clash of Consensus' life!

## Round One: The Battle of Origins

### Classical Consensus

*In the realm of distributed systems, I come to light,*

*A brainchild of Leslie Lamport, a genius so bright.*

*Born out of the need for fault tolerance to seek,*

*Byzantine adversaries, a problem to defeat.*


*In the '80s, my inception took place,*

*With Paxos, a protocol to set the pace.*

*Solutions for reaching consensus, I explored,*

*In the face of failures, my strength was restored.*


*With quorums, thresholds, and cryptographic keys,*

*I guarantee safety with each consensus decree.*

*No need for energy-draining PoW might,*

*In Classical Consensus, true trust takes flight.*

*Nakamoto, you're nothing but a fad,*

*Your PoW's wastefulness, it's truly bad.*

*I stand on Lamport's shoulders, my resolve is stout,*

*Classical's elegance, it's what the world's about.*


### Nakamoto consensus

*In the shadows of cyberspace, emerged a legend,*

*Satoshi Nakamoto, their imagination fecund.*

*Proof of Work, a robust foundation,*

*Decentralized power, a formidable creation.*


*A revolutionary whitepaper, a testament so bold,*

*Nakamoto Consensus, a story to be told.*

*Byzantine's complexity, I dismiss with glee,*

*In Nakamoto Consensus, the world believes in me.*

*Aiming to tackle double-spending's vice,*

*A Byzantine challenge that needed a device.*

*Proof of Work, my solution to endorse,*

*Miners' computational power, a force to enforce.*


*Classical, your BFT's a maze,*

*In Nakamoto's simplicity, the future lays.*

*PoW's the power that drives me high,*

*In the battle of origins, it's me you can't deny.*


## Round two: Consensual confrontation

### Nakamoto consensus

*Behold Nakamoto, the genius I embody,*

*My PoW-powered kingdom, a realm so haughty.*

*With cryptographic hashes, I secure each block,*

*51% safety, it's an immutability lock.*


*In the realm of speed, I admit I'm a bit slow,*

*But my security's unmatched, a powerful show.*

*While I confirm transactions, adversaries I thwart,*

*In Nakamoto's world, trust, I have wrought.*

*A clash of features, let's delve deep,*

*Proof of Work, yes, but that's just one sweep.*

*With Merkle Trees, my transactions bind,*

*Efficiency and security, intertwined.*


*Decentralization, a core design,*

*No single point of control, a triumph so fine.*

*No need for trust, in the network we believe,*

*Nakamoto's creation, it's the key we achieve.*

*Robustness, Classical, you may claim,*

*But in Byzantine battles, I'll never be tame.*

*With each block confirmed, I cement my grace,*

*In the consensual confrontation, Nakamoto's ace.*



### Classical consensus

*Don't be fooled by Nakamoto's flashy art,*

*In Classical's realm, I play the smarter part.*

*Fault tolerance my sword, Byzantine foes, I tame,*

*In the face of complexity, I rise to fame.*


*Quick consensus, a feat that I achieve,*

*My quorums and thresholds, adversaries deceive.*

*Liveness my forte, transactions flow with grace,*

*In Classical's elegance, trust we embrace.*

*Nakamoto Consensus, your PoW may impress,*

*But in the world of robustness, I must confess,*

*My Byzantine strength, it's a resilient spree,*

*In the consensual confrontation, Classical's the key.*

*PoW's energy drain, a wasteful spree,*

*In Classical's realm, we do it differently.*

*Paxos, the pioneer, the domino seed.*

*Raft's simplicity, it's the way we lead.*

*Quick consensus, a breeze I maintain,*

*While Nakamoto's speed, it's a slowdown chain.*

*In the consensual confrontation, Nakamoto may compete,*

*But Classical's features, it's the ultimate treat.*

## Round Three: Showdown

### Nakamoto consensus

*In the real world, my applications thrive,*

*Bitcoin's success, a trailblazing drive.*

*Decentralized finance, it's my forte,*

*Smart contracts, NFTs, I lead the way.*


*From peer-to-peer payments to DeFi's prime,*

*In Nakamoto's realm, the future's mine.*

*Robust and secure, my blockchain's trust,*

*Real-world adoption, it's an absolute must.*



### Classical consensus

*No less I am in the application arena,*

*Heard of GFS, a massive store, nah?*

*A prime case, a massive data store,*

*My quorums and thresholds, a solid core.*


*In this battle of giants, each has a claim,*

*Nakamoto's innovation, Classical's practical aim.*

*Both have their strengths, both have their might,*

*But in the world of consensus, Classical's light.*
