## Round One: The Battle of Origins

### Classical Consensus

_In the realm of distributed systems, I come to light,_

_A brainchild of Leslie Lamport, a genius so bright._

_Born out of the need for fault tolerance to seek,_

_Byzantine adversaries, a problem to defeat._

_In the '80s, my inception took place,_

_With Paxos, a protocol to set the pace._

_Solutions for reaching consensus, I explored,_

_In the face of failures, my strength was restored._

_With quorums, thresholds, and cryptographic keys,_

_I guarantee safety with each consensus decree._

_No need for energy-draining PoW might,_

_In Classical Consensus, true trust takes flight._

_Nakamoto, you're nothing but a fad,_

_Your PoW's wastefulness, it's truly bad._

_I stand on Lamport's shoulders, my resolve is stout,_

_Classical's elegance, it's what the world's about._

### Nakamoto consensus

_In the shadows of cyberspace, emerged a legend,_

_Satoshi Nakamoto, their imagination fecund._

_Proof of Work, a robust foundation,_

_Decentralized power, a formidable creation._

_A revolutionary whitepaper, a testament so bold,_

_Nakamoto Consensus, a story to be told._

_Byzantine's complexity, I dismiss with glee,_

_In Nakamoto Consensus, the world believes in me._

_Aiming to tackle double-spending's vice,_

_A Byzantine challenge that needed a device._

_Proof of Work, my solution to endorse,_

_Miners' computational power, a force to enforce._

_Classical, your BFT's a maze,_

_In Nakamoto's simplicity, the future lays._

_PoW's the power that drives me high,_

_In the battle of origins, it's me you can't deny._

## Round two: Consensual confrontation

### Nakamoto consensus

_Behold Nakamoto, the genius I embody,_

_My PoW-powered kingdom, a realm so haughty._

_With cryptographic hashes, I secure each block,_

_51% safety, it's an immutability lock._

_In the realm of speed, I admit I'm a bit slow,_

_But my security's unmatched, a powerful show._

_While I confirm transactions, adversaries I thwart,_

_In Nakamoto's world, trust, I have wrought._

_A clash of features, let's delve deep,_

_Proof of Work, yes, but that's just one sweep._

_With Merkle Trees, my transactions bind,_

_Efficiency and security, intertwined._

_Decentralization, a core design,_

_No single point of control, a triumph so fine._

_No need for trust, in the network we believe,_

_Nakamoto's creation, it's the key we achieve._

_Robustness, Classical, you may claim,_

_But in Byzantine battles, I'll never be tame._

_With each block confirmed, I cement my grace,_

_In the consensual confrontation, Nakamoto's ace._

### Classical consensus

_Don't be fooled by Nakamoto's flashy art,_

_In Classical's realm, I play the smarter part._

_Fault tolerance my sword, Byzantine foes, I tame,_

_In the face of complexity, I rise to fame._

_Quick consensus, a feat that I achieve,_

_My quorums and thresholds, adversaries deceive._

_Liveness my forte, transactions flow with grace,_

_In Classical's elegance, trust we embrace._

_Nakamoto Consensus, your PoW may impress,_

_But in the world of robustness, I must confess,_

_My Byzantine strength, it's a resilient spree,_

_In the consensual confrontation, Classical's the key._

_PoW's energy drain, a wasteful spree,_

_In Classical's realm, we do it differently._

_Paxos, the pioneer, the domino seed._

_Raft's simplicity, it's the way we lead._

_Quick consensus, a breeze I maintain,_

_While Nakamoto's speed, it's a slowdown chain._

_In the consensual confrontation, Nakamoto may compete,_

_But Classical's features, it's the ultimate treat._

## Round Three: Showdown

### Nakamoto consensus

_In the real world, my applications thrive,_

_Bitcoin's success, a trailblazing drive._

_Decentralized finance, it's my forte,_

_Smart contracts, NFTs, I lead the way._

_From peer-to-peer payments to DeFi's prime,_

_In Nakamoto's realm, the future's mine._

_Robust and secure, my blockchain's trust,_

_Real-world adoption, it's an absolute must._

### Classical consensus

_No less I am in the application arena,_

_Heard of GFS, a massive store, nah?_

_A prime case, a massive data store,_

_My quorums and thresholds, a solid core._

_In this battle of giants, each has a claim,_

_Nakamoto's innovation, Classical's practical aim._

_Both have their strengths, both have their might,_

_But in the world of consensus, Classical's light._
